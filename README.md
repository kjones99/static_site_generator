This is a static site generator built using Python3.  It will copy all static elements from the static directory into the deployment directory and then it will search through a designated directory and convert all '.md' (markdown) files it finds into .html files and
write those .html files into the deployment directory.  Currently this github repo is loaded with a "Tolkien Fan Club" webpage as an example.  To view the generated site you can visit  https://kjones99.github.io/static_site_generator/  
This project was built using a course provided on boot.dev
